		<p class="story">  KATE FRONEK WAS 13 YEARS OLD WHEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ACUTE MYELOID LUKEMIA IN FEBURARY OF 2017. SHORTLY AFTER THE INITIAL DIAGNOSIS A CYTOGENTIC TEST REVEALED KATE HAD MONOSOMY SEVAN, A CHROMSONAL ALTERNATION AFFECTING HER WHITE BLOOD CELLS. THE MONOSOMY SECAN REQURIED HER TO HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE FORM OF TREATMENT. FOLLOWING HER TREATMENTS KATE HAD A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT. KATE FOUGHT A HARD BATTLE AND PASSED AWAY ON JULY 17TH, 2017. KATE WAS FUNNY, KIND, THOUGHTFUL, SENSITIVE, SPUNKY, AND A JOY TO BE AROUND. SHE WAS AMAZING, IF YOU EVER MET HER, THE CHANCES WERE GOOD YOU WERE TOUCHED AND AFFECTED BY HER INFECTIOUS SMILE. HER ABILLITY TO SHOW SENSITIVITY TO OTHERS WAS OUTSANDING. KATE INSPIRED MANY THROUGH HER LIFE. KATE'S FAVORITE BIBLE VERSE WAS JOSHUA 1:9 "HAVE I NOT COMANDED YOU? BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS. DO NOT BE AFRAID; DISCOURAGED, FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL BE WITH YOU WHEREVER YOU GO."    </p>
